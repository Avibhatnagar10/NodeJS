//Designing a Restfull API
as we are making a hybrid server so it a good practise to add api
to run on cross plateform

REST API -JSON

GET /api/users - List all users

GET /api/users/1 - Get the user with ID 1  
GET /api/users/2 - Get the user with ID 2  

Dynamic path paramters
GET /api/users/:id
:id -> Variable | Dynamic
POST /api/users -Create new user

PATCH /api/users/1 - Edit the user with ID 1

DELETE /api/users/1 - Delete the user with ID 1
